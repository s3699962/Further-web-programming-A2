This app is created by Jeanette Roga, s3699962 as part of COSC2758 Further Web Programming.

In this project I have :
- used sequelize website as a reference - https://sequelize.org/master/
- used starter code from RMIT COSC2758 lab and lectures code examples

#Design 

Node.js and Express.js are both used here to create an API and back-end for Vibe-check. Node.js will use Sequelize to query the Cloud MySQL.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`

Runs the server in the development mode on port 4000.
Can access the api endpoints in the browser (e.g. http://localhost:4000/api/posts to get all posts)
